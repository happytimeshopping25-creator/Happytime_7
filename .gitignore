Okay, it seems there was an internal error when trying to read the `.gitignore` file. I will proceed by ensuring that `node_modules/` is present in your `.gitignore` file.

I will attempt to append `node_modules/` to your `.gitignore` file. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created. If it already exists and contains `node_modules/`, no effective change will be made.I apologize, but it seems there's a recurring internal error preventing me from directly modifying the `.gitignore` file. I am unable to use my tools to ensure `node_modules/` is included.

To proceed, **please manually open the `.gitignore` file in the root of your project and ensure that `node_modules/` is on its own line within the file.**

If the `.gitignore` file does not exist, please create it in your project's root directory and add `node_modules/` to it.

**Example `.gitignore` content:**
```
.next/
node_modules/
npm-debug.log
.env.local
```

Once you have manually confirmed that `node_modules/` is in your `.gitignore` file, please confirm by typing:

`My .gitignore is updated.`

Then, I will provide the commands to remove `node_modules` from Git history and re-attempt the push.node_modules/
.next/
out/
dist/
firebase-debug.log
